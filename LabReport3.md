# Lab Report 3  
## Part 1: Bugs 
The method I will use is int[] reversed(int[] arr) in ArrayExamples.java. Below is the initial buggy code.  
```
static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return arr;
  }
```
**1. A failure-inducing input for the buggy program**
   
Inserting the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] into the method reversed() produces a failure in JUnit testing. Below is the code used to conduct the JUnit Test.  
```
@Test
  public void testReversedUpToFive() {
    int[] input1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int [] expectedResult = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1};
    assertArrayEquals(expectedResult, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
``` 

**2. An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure**
Inserting the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] into the method reversed() does not produce a failure in JUnit testing. Below is the code used to conduct the JUnit Test.  
```
@Test
  public void testReversedFiveZeroes() {
    int[] input1 = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
    int [] expectedResult = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
    assertArrayEquals(expectedResult, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
```

**3. The symptom, as the output of running the tests**  
The symptom is that all values of the supposedly reversed array are replaced by 0. In the failures of JUnit testing, 
all expected values are marked to be a comparison error since the expected value is not equal to 0. Below are more tests 
showing that only arrays with all 0 values successfully have their arrays reversed.  
```
@Test
  public void testReversedUpToFive() {
    int[] input1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int [] expectedResult = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1};
    assertArrayEquals(expectedResult, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }

  @Test
  public void testReversedFiveZeroes() {
    int[] input1 = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
    int [] expectedResult = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
    assertArrayEquals(expectedResult, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }

  @Test
  public void testReversedTwoZeros() {
    int[] input1 = {0, 0};
    int [] expectedResult = {0, 0};
    System.out.println(ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
    assertArrayEquals(expectedResult, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }

  @Test
  public void testReversedNotAllZero(){
    int[] input1 = {0, 1, 2, 0};
    int [] expectedResult = {0, 2, 1, 0};
    System.out.println(ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
    assertArrayEquals(expectedResult, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }

  @Test
  public void testReversedMirror(){
    int[] input1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1};
    int [] expectedResult = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1};
    System.out.println(ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
    assertArrayEquals(expectedResult, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
```
The screenshot below shows the terminal output after all the above tests are run together.  
*Note: The output was too long for one screenshot. The ouput shown at the beginning of the second screenshot follows directly after the output at the end of the first screenshot.  
![Image](test1.png)![Image](test2.png)    
The only tests to pass were the tests with inputs of all zeroes in the array. Every other test shows a failure with the error being a 
comparison difference of the expected value vs 0 at the index where the first non-zero expected value appears.  

**4. The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it**   
Below is the before code:  
```
static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return arr;
  }
```
Below is the after code that fixes the bug:  
```
static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for (int i = 0; i<arr.length; i++){
      newArray[i] = arr[arr.length-1-i];
    }
    return newArray;
  }
```
In the before code, the for loop assigns values from the newly created Array to the original array backward. 
However, since newArray was created without having a value assigned, the value at every index was assigned 0 by default. 
Then assigning values from newArray to arr would make arr, the returned array, all 0s as well. The after code assigns values from arr to 
newArray, ensuring that the values being assigned to the return array are not all 0s.  


## Part 2: Researching Commands  
The command I will research is grep.   
**1. Option 1: -l**  
   Using -l gives the names of files that contain the word searched for. The output is only the file names.
   <br/><br/>
   Example 1:  
   ```
   $ grep -l "RNA" technical/biomed/*.txt
   technical/biomed/1471-2091-2-11.txt
   technical/biomed/1471-2091-2-13.txt
   technical/biomed/1471-2091-2-5.txt
   technical/biomed/1471-2091-3-14.txt
   technical/biomed/1471-2091-3-18.txt
   technical/biomed/1471-2091-3-22.txt
   technical/biomed/1471-2091-3-23.txt
   technical/biomed/1471-2105-2-1.txt
   technical/biomed/1471-2105-2-8.txt
   technical/biomed/1471-2105-3-17.txt
   technical/biomed/1471-2105-3-18.txt
   technical/biomed/1471-2105-3-2.txt
   technical/biomed/1471-2105-3-22.txt
   ```
   *Note: The above output shown is only a part of the whole output due to length.  
The command ran above finds and lists out all the files that contain the word "RNA" somewhere within the file. This command can be useful in situations where we want to read about certain medical research ideas and findings on RNA. Giving us the file names that contain    the word "RNA" can help guide us to identify which articles to read about for information on RNA, instead of needing to go through all files to check for the     word "RNA".
   <br/><br/>
   Example 2:  
   ```  
   $ grep -l "Clean Air Act" technical/government/*/*.txt  
   technical/government/Env_Prot_Agen/bill.txt
   technical/government/Env_Prot_Agen/final.txt
   technical/government/Env_Prot_Agen/jeffordslieberm.txt
   technical/government/Env_Prot_Agen/multi102902.txt
   technical/government/Env_Prot_Agen/nov1.txt
   technical/government/Env_Prot_Agen/ro_clear_skies_book.txt
   technical/government/Env_Prot_Agen/section-by-section_summary.txt
   technical/government/Env_Prot_Agen/tech_adden.txt
   technical/government/Gen_Account_Office/og96026.txt
   technical/government/Gen_Account_Office/og96027.txt
   technical/government/Gen_Account_Office/og96042.txt
   technical/government/Gen_Account_Office/og96045.txt
   technical/government/Gen_Account_Office/og97045.txt
   technical/government/Gen_Account_Office/og98045.txt
   technical/government/Gen_Account_Office/og98046.txt
   ```
   *Note: The above output shown is only a part of the whole output due to length.  
   The command ran above finds and lists out all the files that contain the term "Clean Air Act" somewhere within the file. This would be useful if we wanted to read more about the contents of the Clean Air Act and amendments/discussions on it. Giving us the file names that contain the term "Clean Air Act" can help guide us to identify which articles to read about for information on RNA, instead of needing to go through all files to check for the word "Clean Air Act".
   <br/><br/>
   The -l command option was researched on [Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Grep): https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Grep 
   <br/><br/>
**2. Option 2: -n**  
   Using -n with the grep command outputs a line number in front of the matching line found with the grep command.
   Example 1:   
   ```
   $ grep -n "At 8:19" technical/911report/chapter-1.txt
   76:    At 8:19, Ong reported:"The cockpit is not answering,
   somebody's stabbed in business class
   and I think there's Mace that we can't breathe
   I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked."
   She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants.  
   ```
   The command ran above lists out the line at which the words "At 8:19" can be found in the given file. This can be useful if we know that we stopped reading a certain file midway through, and want to pick up where we left off again. We most likely would remember some words of the last line we read instead of the line number, so we can find which line we start to read again from easily.
   <br/><br/>
   Example 2:  
   ```
   $ grep -n "intoxication" technical/government/Alcohol_Problems/*.txt

   ```
   *Note: The above output shown is only a part of the whole output due to length.  
   The command ran above gives a line number next to the files that contain the word "intoxication". This can be useful if we have a presentation or test coming up and need to do a quick review of certain topics. Using the -n command for certain words in a directory can help us run through the entire directory and find the files and specific lines for us to read through for a quick recap.  
<br/><br/>
   The -n command option was researched on [Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Grep): https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Grep 
   <br/><br/>
**3. Option 3: -i**  
   Using -i with the grep command acts as usual, but the term is not case-sensitive. For example, searching for the character "a" and "A" would be the same thing
   if using -i.  
   Example 1:  
   ```
   $ grep -i "methods" technical/biomed/1468*.txt
   technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt:        Materials and methods

   ```
<br/><br/>
   *Note: The above output shown is only a part of the whole output due to length.  
   The command ran above shows all the files and text at the line where the word "methods" is found regardless of capitalization. This command would be useful if we want to look at the experimental methods of different research papers. Some research papers use "Materials and methods" where the m is lowercase, and other papers use "Methods" where the m is uppercase. Using grep without the -i option for "methods" would miss the lines where the research paper used "Methods". 
   
   Example 2:  
   ```
   $ grep -i "CEll" technical/biomed/1471-213X-1*.txt
   technical/biomed/1471-213X-1-12.txt:          The cell cycle stages of ear fibroblasts after

   ```
   *Note: The above output shown is only a part of the whole output due to length.    
   The command ran above shows all the files and text at the line where the word "CEll" is found regardless of capitalization. This command would be useful if we want to read about cells. Using the grep command with no option would not include the subheadings that capitalize the C in cells. Furthermore, if someone is typing too fast and accidentally type the E with the shift key activated, they would still get their wanted output even if they realized they made a typo error in the command.   
<br/><br/>
   The -i command option was researched on [Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Grep): https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Grep 
   <br/><br/>
**4. Option 4: -c**   
   Using -c doesn't output any matching lines but instead outputs a number that tells us how many lines have the term we searched for with the grep command.   
   Example 1: 
   ```
   $ grep -c "terrorism" technical/911report/*.txt  
   technical/911report/chapter-1.txt:1
   technical/911report/chapter-10.txt:14
   technical/911report/chapter-11.txt:37
   technical/911report/chapter-12.txt:40
   technical/911report/chapter-13.1.txt:40
   technical/911report/chapter-13.2.txt:0
   technical/911report/chapter-13.3.txt:47
   technical/911report/chapter-13.4.txt:30
   technical/911report/chapter-13.5.txt:24
   technical/911report/chapter-2.txt:2
   technical/911report/chapter-3.txt:149
   technical/911report/chapter-5.txt:1
   technical/911report/chapter-6.txt:67
   technical/911report/chapter-7.txt:1
   technical/911report/chapter-8.txt:13
   technical/911report/chapter-9.txt:0
   technical/911report/preface.txt:0
   ```
   *Note: The above output shown is only a part of the whole output due to length.  
   The command ran above shows the number of times the word "terrorism" is found in each individual file in the directory. This command would be useful if we want to read about past terrorist attacks and want to filter out low-relevance from high-relevance files. The higher the count of the number of times the word "terrorism" comes up, the more related to terrorist attacks the .txt file would be.  

   Example 2:     
   ```
   $ grep -c "RNA" technical/biomed/*.txt
   technical/biomed/1471-2105-1-1.txt:0
   technical/biomed/1471-2105-2-1.txt:1

   technical/biomed/1471-2105-3-24.txt:0
   technical/biomed/1471-2105-3-26.txt:15
   ```
   *Note: The above output shown is only a part of the whole output due to length.  
   The command ran above shows the number of times the word "RNA" is found in each individual file in the directory. This command would be useful if we had to prepare a presentation on RNA due in a few days because we procrastinated. Using the -c option, we can filter through the files to find and read the research papers that have high counts of the term "RNA" and would more likely be relevant to the presentation topic. 
   <br/><br/>
   The -c command option was researched on [Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Grep): https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Grep
