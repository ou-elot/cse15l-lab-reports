There is no output in the terminal, but running the command cd will reset the directory to home. If the current directory is home, it seems like nothing has changed. Changing the directory to lecture1 before running the command will change the directory to home after the command is run. In the beginning, the command line shows the directory as [user@sahara ~]. Changing the directory to lecture1 makes it [user@sahara ~ lecture1]. Having no arguments at the end of the command is the same thing as changing the directory to " ", which was the case at the very beginning.


**b ) Command with path to directory argument**

There is no output, but the directory was changed depending on the path given.
